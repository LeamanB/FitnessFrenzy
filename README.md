About Fitness Frenzy
Hello, thanks for taking the time to view my website. This is the second SAP I've made from scratch.

How the site works:
When users come to the homepage, they have the option to put in their BMI. If the user's BMI is overweight, the page redirects to the Fat Loss NOW page. If normal weight or overweight, the page redirects to the Fast Muscle Building page.

BMI judgements are made from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's classifications of BMI: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm
